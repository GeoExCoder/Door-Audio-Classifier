# Door-Audio-Classifier
Urban Mining is the reuse and repurpose of building components from abandoned or inefficient buildings, to new efficient ones. They require effective material and component audits of existing buildings, and this classifier aims to make the process simple. Using the audio from door knocks, it characterises if a door is made of wood, metal, or glass.
